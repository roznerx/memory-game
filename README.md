# "Build a memory game" for the "React Practice Calendar" challenge by reactpractice.dev 

Made by **roznerx** (ignaciorosner@gmail.com)

- Fourth day of the calendar, this time doing this fun memory game
- I loved doing the logic for the game board: went through many options before the final version, trimming doing conditional until I came up with a solution I liked
- Copied the main branch of the repo provided by the challenge, because the original had a solution in another branch and I didn't want to get tempted into looking into it!
- Have two branches besides main: ```initial-solution``` and ```refactor```; the first one is what the project looked like once finished, while the second one expands upon the first with a cleanr code by making components and trimming down repetition, plus adding some extras like a modal when winning and a reset button!

**NOTE:** had a lot of fun with it, even thought I had to write down the game's logic while I was coding it! It is simple, yet required a little bit of planning!
